# Microsoft Movie Analysis

Author: Hogan Byun


## Project Overview

This project analyizes movie databases in order to assist a potential, new movie studio in making decisions. Data analysis shows that, depending on specific goals, Microsoft should aim to create either an action, adventure, drama, or comedy movie. Further details, such as budget and release time, provide more flexibility. Microsoft can use these options to choose the best choices that fit their needs and constraints.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. Exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office will be able to translate into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

Data is taken from the following movie databases: IMDB, TheMovieDB.org, TN. Movies are identified by unique keys. Data about each movie can include information such as: release date, budget, gross, ratings, and other data that may help investigate this problem. 

### Key Points

* **Your analysis should yield three concrete business recommendations.** The ultimate purpose of exploratory analysis is not just to learn about the data, but to help an organization perform better. Explicitly relate your findings to business needs by recommending actions that you think the business (Microsoft) should take.

* **Communicating about your work well is extremely important.** Your ability to provide value to an organization - or to land a job there - is directly reliant on your ability to communicate with them about what you have done and why it is valuable. Create a storyline your audience (the head of Microsoft's new movie studio) can follow by walking them through the steps of your process, highlighting the most important points and skipping over the rest.

* **Use plenty of visualizations.** Visualizations are invaluable for exploring your data and making your findings accessible to a non-technical audience. Spotlight visuals in your presentation, but only ones that relate directly to your recommendations. Simple visuals are usually best (e.g. bar charts and line graphs), and don't forget to format them well (e.g. labels, titles).

### Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis and visualization through Python and associated libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn. Time-series, bar, and regression plots are all utilized to help decide what movies to create. 

## Project Submission and Review

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic to learn how to submit your project and how it will be reviewed. Your project must pass review for you to progress to the next Phase.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
