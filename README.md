# Microsoft Movie Analysis

Author: Hogan Byun


## Project Overview

This project analyizes movie databases in order to assist a potential, new movie studio in making decisions. Data analysis shows that, depending on specific goals, Microsoft should aim to create either an action, adventure, drama, or comedy movie. Further details, such as budget and release time, provide more flexibility. Microsoft can use these options to choose the best choices that fit their needs and constraints.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. Exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office will be able to translate into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

Data is taken from the following movie databases: IMDB, TheMovieDB.org, TN. Movies are identified by unique keys. Data about each movie can include information such as: release date, budget, gross, ratings, and other data that may help investigate this problem. 

### Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis and visualization through Python and associated libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn. Time-series, bar, and regression plots are all utilized to help decide what movies to create. In particular, analysis was done on profit and ROI data, genre-based data, budgeting data, and month-by-month data. 

### Results
Firstly, as a data scientist, I aim to provide recommendations, but the decisions and choices are ultimately up to the client. Here, I provided two tracks that Microsoft can take, depending on what their goal is for a specific movie: maximizing profit or maximizing ROI.
